We value your trust, and we understand that handling your financial information with care is one of our most important responsibilities. Our policies, procedures and protections are always evolving to stay ahead of new strategies used by fraudsters.</p><p>Confidentiality and the security of personal and financial information of our customers and clients is the highest priority at Bank of America. We have multiple layers of security protection in place to protect clients, customers, employees and our company. We have a sustainable cybersecurity program built on accountability, consistency and measurement.</p><p>In addition, we have a strict code of ethics for all employees that requires confidential treatment of client information. Only those who need to know a client's financial information - because they provide services a client might need - are authorized to have access to it. All Bank of America employees must complete information protection training annually. Bank of America also maintains physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect against unauthorized access to client information.</p><p>If we believe an account is at risk for fraud, we will attempt to contact you using the contact information you’ve shared with us, so make sure that information is current. If we do contact you, please review and respond promptly.</p><p>While our global information security team remains vigilant and monitors potential threats to help keep you safe, there’s a lot you can do, too.

Please review the FAQs for recognizing fraud for additional information about how you can make sure you’re receiving authentic communications from Bank of America (and what to do if you have any doubts).</p><p>You should always approach unsolicited email containing urgent appeals for security or personal information with great caution. Be sure to confirm the validity of email messages that appear to come from trusted sources by carefully examining the email address itself, as well as the content within it.</p><p>All email we send to you contains authentication markers (such as a digital signature), which help your email provider or software determine whether or not it is junk mail. If an email appears to be from Bank of America but ends up in your junk email folder, leave it there. (Note that if the email address we have on file for security alerts is one you automatically forward to another personal email account, it increases the likelihood that your email provider or software will incorrectly classify it as junk mail.)</p><p>Other measures you can take include:</p><ul><li>Create complex passwords and PINs not easily associated with you, memorize them and use multi-factor authentication (for example: a password plus a one-time authorization code) where available. Use a strong, unique password for each of your accounts. Visit the What you can do tab on our <a href='https://www.bankofamerica.com/security-center/online-mobile-banking-privacy/online-banking-security/'>Online Banking security page</a> for tips on how to create strong passwords.</li><li>Question suspicious emails and never click on any link unless you’re absolutely certain it’s authentic. Bank of America will never ask you provide your Social Security number, ATM or debit card PIN or any other sensitive information in response to an email. (For more information about email fraud, view our FAQs about recognizing fraud.)</li><li>Download the <a href='https://www.bankofamerica.com/online-banking/mobile.go'>Bank of America Mobile Banking app</a> and allow push alerts for more secure communication about your accounts. Review and respond to alerts promptly. Keep your contact information, especially your cell phone number and email address, current. Turn on location services when making a purchase or signing in and allow location-based anti-fraud and security permissions.</li><li>Use your Security Center to manage your security options, add optional extra security (multi-factor authentication) to help verify your identity each time you sign in and more. <a href='https://www.bankofamerica.com/security-center/online-banking/'>Learn more about Security Center</a></li></ul>"

                        <p>Bank of America takes the protection of your personal information very seriously. We value your trust, and we understand that handling your financial information with care is one of our most important responsibilities. Our policies, procedures and protections are always evolving to stay ahead of new strategies used by fraudsters.</p>
                        <p>Confidentiality and the security of personal and financial information of our customers and clients is the highest priority at Bank of America. We have multiple layers of security protection in place to protect clients, customers, employees and our company. We have a sustainable cybersecurity program built on accountability, consistency and measurement.</p>
                        <p>In addition, we have a strict code of ethics for all employees that requires confidential treatment of client information. Only those who need to know a client's financial information — because they provide services a client might need — are authorized to have access to it. All Bank of America employees must complete information protection training annually. Bank of America also maintains physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect against unauthorized access to client information.</p>
                        <p>If we believe an account is at risk for fraud, we will attempt to contact you using the contact information you’ve shared with us, so make sure that information is current. If we do contact you, please review and respond promptly.</p>
                        <p>While our global information security team remains vigilant and monitors potential threats to help keep you safe, there’s a lot you can do, too. Various security pages on our site, for example <a id="onlineBankingSecurityLink" href="/privacy/online-mobile-banking-privacy/online-banking-security.go">Online Banking Security</a> and <a id="creditSecurityLink" href="/privacy/accounts-cards/checking-savings-security.go">Credit &amp; Debit Card Security</a>, contain specific information under the <strong>What you can do tab</strong> on the page. You should also familiarize yourself with <a id="privacyNoticeLink" href="/privacy/privacy-overview.go">our privacy notices</a> and watch the short <a id="financialInformationLink" href="https://bettermoneyhabits.bankofamerica.com/en/privacy-security/protecting-financial-information">Keeping your financial information safe</a> video from Better Money Habits.</p>
                        <p>Together, we can help prevent, identify and resolve fraud events faster.</p>

                        <p>One of the easiest and most effective ways you can protect your accounts is to take advantage of the resources we provide on our site. For example, our <a id="onlineBankingSecurityLink" href="/privacy/online-mobile-banking-privacy/online-banking-security.go">Online Banking Security</a> and <a id="creditSecurityLink" href="/privacy/accounts-cards/checking-savings-security.go">Credit &amp; Debit Card Security</a> pages contain specific information under the <strong>What you can do tab</strong>. You should also familiarize yourself with our <a id="privacyNoticeLink" href="/privacy/privacy-overview.go">our privacy notices</a> and watch the short <a id="financialInformationLink" href="https://bettermoneyhabits.bankofamerica.com/en/privacy-security/protecting-financial-information">Keeping your financial information safe</a> video from Better Money Habits.</p>
                        <p>Bank of America will never ask you to reply to an email with any personal information such as your Social Security number, ATM or PIN. Please review the FAQs for recognizing fraud for additional information about how you can make sure you’re receiving authentic communications from Bank of America (and what to do if you have any doubts).</p>
                        <p>You should always approach unsolicited email containing urgent appeals for security or personal information with great caution. Be sure to confirm the validity of email messages that appear to come from trusted sources by carefully examining the email address itself, as well as the content within it.</p>
                        <p>All email we send to you contains authentication markers (such as a digital signature), which help your email provider or software determine whether or not it is junk mail. If an email appears to be from Bank of America but ends up in your junk email folder, leave it there. (Note that if the email address we have on file for security alerts is one you automatically forward to another personal email account, it increases the likelihood that your email provider or software will incorrectly classify it as junk mail.)</p>
                        <p>Other measures you can take include:</p>
                        <ul class="list">
                         <li>Create complex passwords and PINs not easily associated with you, memorize them and use multi-factor authentication (for example: a password plus a one-time authorization code) where available. Use a strong, unique password for each of your accounts. Visit the What you can do tab on our <a id="onlineBankingSecurity2Link" href="/privacy/online-mobile-banking-privacy/online-banking-security.go">Online Banking security page</a> for tips on how to create strong passwords.</li>
                         <li>Question suspicious emails and never click on any link unless you’re absolutely certain it’s authentic. Bank of America will never ask you provide your Social Security number, ATM or debit card PIN or any other sensitive information in response to an email. (For more information about email fraud, view our FAQs about recognizing fraud.)</li>
                         <li>Download the <a id="mobileAppLink" href="/online-banking/mobile.go">Bank of America Mobile Banking app</a> and allow push alerts for more secure communication about your accounts. Review and respond to alerts promptly. Keep your contact information, especially your cell phone number and email address, current. Turn on location services when making a purchase or signing in and allow location-based anti-fraud and security permissions.</li>
                         <li>Use your Security Center to manage your security options, add optional extra security (multi-factor authentication) to help verify your identity each time you sign in and more. <a id="securityCenterLink" href="/privacy/online-mobile-banking-privacy/security-center.go">Learn more about Security Center</a></li>

                        <p>Identity theft occurs when someone uses your personal identifiable information to commit fraudulent acts such as withdrawing money from your bank account, opening new credit cards, applying for loans or even gaining employment. The most common signs of identity theft include:</p>
                        <ul class="list">
                         <li>Unauthorized withdrawals from your account</li>
                         <li>Bills for unfamiliar debt or failure to receive bills</li>
                         <li>Suspicious charges on your account</li>
                         <li>New accounts or loans you didn’t apply for</li>
                         <li>Being denied credit unexpectedly</li>
                         <li>The IRS notifying you that more than one tax return was filed in your name, or that you have income from an employer you don't work for</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Here are some proactive steps you can take now to help protect yourself from identity theft:</p>
                        <ul class="list">
                         <li>Review your credit report frequently and carefully by requesting a free copy of your credit report every 12 months from <a id="creditReportLink" href="http://www.annualcreditreport.com/" class="spa-ui-layer-link spa-fn" data-options="{&quot;interstitialType&quot;:&quot;leaving-site&quot;,&quot;interstitialBranding&quot;:&quot;default&quot;,&quot;targetAction&quot;:&quot;new-tab&quot;}">www.annualcreditreport.com<span class="spa-ada-text ada-hidden">&nbsp;layer</span></a></li>
                         <li>Download the <a id="mobileAppLink" href="/online-banking/mobile.go">Bank of America Mobile Banking app</a> and allow push alerts for more secure communication about your accounts. Review and respond to alerts promptly. Keep your contact information, especially your cell phone number and email address, current. Turn on location services when making a purchase or signing in and allow location-based anti-fraud and security permissions.</li>
                         <li>Create complex passwords and PINs not easily associated with you, memorize them and use multi-factor authentication (for example: a password plus a one-time authorization code) when available each time you sign in to Online or Mobile Banking. Use a strong, unique password for each of your accounts.

                        <p>Using your computer without taking proper precautions can leave you vulnerable to personal and financial information theft. It’s important for everyone to know how to safely shop online, use social media, download software and navigate through email.</p>

                        <p>Bank of America’s Mobile Banking service incorporates the convenience you want with industry-leading safety and security features that provide peace of mind. In addition to the steps we take to protect you, there are a number of steps you can take, too.</p>
                        <p>The best way to defend a lost smartphone or any other mobile device against intruders is to take precautions while the phone is in your possession. This includes taking steps like protecting your data with a PIN, fingerprint or retinal/facial recognition when available on your device.</p>
                        <p>Here are some other common-sense steps you can take to help protect yourself and the important information on your mobile device:</p>
                        <ul class="list">
                         <li>Keep your operating system, antivirus software and applications up to date as recommended by the device manufacturer or mobile carrier</li>
                         <li>Only download apps from trusted sources like the Apple App Store or Google Play</li>
                         <li>Avoid using free public Wi-Fi for financial transactions unless it includes Wi-Fi Protected Access 2 (WPA2 security) enabling you to set up a secure password</li>
                         <li>Turn off Wi-Fi and Bluetooth services when you're not using them</li>
                         <li>Avoid clicking on links from unknown sources</li>
                         <li>Don't root or jailbreak your phone to gain access to more apps and functions. This not only voids your warranty, but also removes manufacturer built-in security and leaves your device open to malware attacks. It's best to leave your phone or tablet as is.</li>

                        <p>Bank of America’s Mobile Banking service incorporates the convenience you want with industry-leading safety and security features that provide peace of mind. In addition to the steps we take to protect you, there are a number of steps you can take, too.</p>
                        <p>First and foremost, if you’ve lost your smartphone or mobile device, take these steps immediately:</p>
                        <ul class="list">
                         <li>Alert your mobile carrier</li>
                         <li>Alert Bank of America (and any other financial institution you access using your device)</li>
                         <li>Change any usernames and passwords that may have been stored on your mobile device</li>
                         <li>If you’re using any cloud-based services, sign in to them and disable remote access and alerts for any mobile apps you have linked to your missing phone or device</li>
                         <li>File a police report, if necessary</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The best way to defend a lost smartphone or any other mobile device against intruders is to take precautions while the phone is in your possession. This includes taking steps like protecting your data with a PIN or fingerprint sign-in (biometrics) and enabling remote phone-finder and data-wiping features.</p>
                        <p>Here are some other common-sense steps you can take to help protect yourself and the important information on your mobile device.</p>
                        <ul class="list">
                         <li>Keep your operating system, antivirus software and applications up to date as recommended by the device manufacturer or mobile carrier</li>
                         <li>Only download apps from trusted sources like the Apple App Store or Google Play</li>
                         <li>Avoid public Wi-Fi for financial transactions</li>
                         <li>Turn off Wi-Fi and Bluetooth services when you’re not using them</li>
                         <li>Avoid clicking on links from unknown sources</li>
                         <li>Don’t root or jailbreak your phone to gain access to more apps and functions. This not only voids your warranty, but also removes manufacturer built-in security and leaves your device open to malware attacks. It’s best to leave your phone or tablet as is.</li>
                        </ul>

                    <p>We strive to provide you with information about products and services you might find interesting and useful. Relationship-based ads and online behavioral advertising help us do that.</p>
                    <p>Here's how it works: We gather information about your online activities, such as the searches you conduct on our Sites and the pages you visit. This information may be used to deliver advertising on our Sites and offline (for example, by phone, email and direct mail) that's customized to meet specific interests you may have.</p>
                    <p>If you prefer that we do not use this information, you may <a id="WebsiteAdPractices_OptOut" href="/security-center/online-privacy-notice/#advertising-on-our-sites" target="_blank">opt out of online behavioral advertising</a>. If you opt out, though, you may still receive generic advertising. In addition, financial advisors/Client Managers may continue to use information collected online to provide product and service information in accordance with account agreements.</p>
                    <p>Also, if you opt out of online behavioral advertising, you may still see ads when you sign in to your account, for example through Online Banking or MyMerrill. These ads are based on your specific account relationships with us.</p>
                    <p>To learn more about relationship-based ads, online behavioral advertising and our privacy practices, please review <a id="WebsiteAdPractices_PrivacyNotice" href="/security-center/online-privacy-notice/" target="_blank">Bank of America Online Privacy Notice</a> and our <a id="Online-privacy-faqs" href="/security-center/faq/online-privacy/" target="_blank">Online Privacy FAQs</a>.</p>
