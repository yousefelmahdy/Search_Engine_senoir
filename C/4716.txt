Many people are not even aware what the DNS is or does but if you have ever been online you are using a DNS and Cloudflare does it the best from the time it takes your phone to look something up to the time it takes your website to resolve. The fastest way to connect to the internet from any device WiFi or Cellular this is it with the added comfort of not only Internet Privacy &amp; Security. Tired of your ISP constantly controlling your IP or practically every site selling your info and constantly data mining your phone burning up your memory, battery, and slowing your phone down then 1.1.1.1 helps with all of the above. Took under 30 seconds from downloading the App to having it fully functioning on my XsMax. The only issue I have had is since I upgraded my phone with 1.1.1.1 I have had Viber, my VoIP calling &amp; messaging favorite freeze up on several occasions which I never had an issue with previously but may be an issue with them or Apples new software, in any case erasing and downloading the Viber App again gets it right back but has been an issue because once it freezes nothing can clear it and you can’t make or receive messages while it’s frozen. I’m assuming a software compatibility some VoIP services have while you are using any VPN.</p> <!---->

In regard to Windows devices, the X-VPNVPN gives a thorough slideshow as to how to download, but even so following the instructions methodically, it’s fails to connect the VPN Configuration. <br>X-VPNVPN CUSTOMER SERVICE, has FAILED to provide their services as multiple emails have been routed up their way in regard to this UNSOLVED problem. Customer Service will provide a manual VPN Configuration list for one to plug into their VPN Apple settings, but even their GUIDANCE has FAILED to connect. <br>Many MILITARY SERVICE MEMBERS have had NUMEROUS COMPLAINTS about this situation and have yet to solve it. There has been no refund, or money back guaranteed for their provided services. The mass majority of this incident DOES NOT intend for their money back, but intends for X-VPNVPN to come to a CONCLUSION for a SOLUTION to maneuver through this problem.</p> <!---->

(No, I’m not talking about social media companies, because you can choose what you share on social media.) - I’m talking about 3 types of companies who secretly track everything you do on every computer or mobile phone that you use.<br>(1) Your DNS provider (usually the same company that provides your internet service); (2) your search engine (usually your home page), and (3) your web browser - all of these companies have one thing in common: they watch what you do on the web, and they build a profile of who you are, and then they sell that data without your knowledge, to thousands of advertisers.<br>If you value your privacy, my strong recommendation is to use 1.1.1.1 for your DNS provider (even without WARP, it is solid); use DuckDuckGo as your search engine, and use FireFox as your web browser.<br>I am a professional in the security and privacy world, and I’m telling you the truth.

The application did not give me a notification that I needed to accept the terms of service, but until I did my device could not access the internet with or without wifi, nor could I even access the VPN controls in my Settings as it was constantly in a state of flux - turning on and turning off 5 times per second - and “clicking” on it did nothing. This app, by merely updating the terms of service, completely disabled my device’s ability to access any networks, load any data, or otherwise function as a phone/smart phone. It is imperative that this gets fixed before I raise my rating but I will happily give it 5 stars once it is.","title":"Good but buggy - for now?","userName":"Ducypoo"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"1459872679","type":"media/in-app","attributes":{"description":{"standard":"1 month of unlimited WARP+"},"isMerchandisedEnabled":false,"isMerchandisedVisibleByDefault":false,"isSubscription":true,"name":"WARP+ UNLIMITED","offerName":"plus.warp.1m","releaseDate":"2009-06-17T00:00:00.000Z","subscriptionFamilyId":"20518779","url":"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/warp-unlimited/id1423538627"},"relationships":{"offers":{"data":[{"id":"ember37160665","type":"offer"}]}}},{"id":"1117941776","type":"media/app","attributes":{},"relationships":{}},{"id":"952597596","type":"media/app","attributes":{},"relationships":{}},{"id":"1039690192","type":"media/app","attributes":{},"relationships":{}},{"id":"919884616","type":"media/app","attributes":{},"relationships":{}},{"id":"855256130","type":"media/app","attributes":{},"relationships":{}},{"id":"1069388206","type":"media/app","attributes":{},"relationships":{}},{"id":"999025824","type":"media/app","attributes":{},"relationships":{}},{"id":"1356177741","type":"media/app","attributes":{},"relationships":{}},{"id":"1492285103","type":"media/app","attributes":{},"relationships":{}},{"id":"1473774730","type":"media/app","attributes":{},"relationships":{}},{"id":"1315808068","type":"media/developer","attributes":{"genreNames":[],"name":"Cloudflare","url":"https://apps.apple.com/us/developer/cloudflare/id1315808068"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"6002","type":"media/genre","attributes":{"name":"Utilities","url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/genre/id6002","parentName":"App Store","parentId":"36"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"1423538627-ios","type":"media/app-platform","attributes":{"offers":[{"buyParams":"productType=C\u0026price=0\u0026salableAdamId=1423538627\u0026pricingParameters=STDQ\u0026pg=default\u0026appExtVrsId=841344026","type":"get","priceFormatted":"$0.00","price":0,"currencyCode":"USD","assets":[{"flavor":"iosSoftware","size":60367872}]},{"buyParams":"productType=C\u0026price=0\u0026salableAdamId=1423538627\u0026pricingParameters=SWUPD\u0026pg=default\u0026appExtVrsId=841344026","type":"update","priceFormatted":"$0.00","price":0,"currencyCode":"USD","assets":[{"flavor":"iosSoftware","size":60367872}]}],"bundleId":"com.cloudflare.1dot1dot1dot1","editorialArtwork":{"brandLogo":{"width":1080,"height":1080,"url":"https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features114/v4/81/06/f6/8106f65f-9dd7-d960-fc6d-102bc3939685/source/{w}x{h}{c}.{f}","bgColor":"000000","textColor1":"f2f2f2","textColor2":"e5e5e5","textColor3":"c1c1c1","textColor4":"b7b7b7"}},"hasInAppPurchases":true,"hasMessagesExtension":false,"isAppleWatchSupported":false,"isGameCenterEnabled":false,"isHiddenFromSpringboard":false,"isSiriSupported":false,"releaseDate":"2018-11-11T00:00:00.000Z","requiresGameController":false,"subtitle":"A More Private Internet","supportsGameController":false,"supportsPassbook":false,"copyright":"© 2020 Cloudflare Inc.","description":{"standard":"1.1.1.1 w/ WARP – the free app that makes your Internet more private.\n\n1.1.1.1 w/ WARP makes your Internet more private and safer.
