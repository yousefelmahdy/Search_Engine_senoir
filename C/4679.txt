            <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I’ve been using this app for years and it has been great. It works well and is a nice quality app. I have a few problems though, and it has to do with the subscription tab. The first problem is that it will often say that someone has posted (showing a little blue dot on their icon) but they haven’t. No big deal, but if I click it to make the blue dot go away, then go back to a different tab (such as the home) it will put the blue dot back. That makes it so there is a red dot on the subscription button which just bothers me. It also usually happens to people with less that 1k subs.<br>The second problem I have is that I don’t get all community posts. I am subscribed to a lot of people, and a good amount of them make posts regularly. Maybe this is supposed to happen, but I don’t get them all, and I would like to. <br>The last problem (which I find more funny) is that when I click all to see everyone I am subscribed to, it shows everyone as normal. But, if I leave the app and come back, or slide up on my phone (to show brightness or flashlight) it will switch around the names so that they do not match the right person.<br><br>Other than these three problems, the app is amazing.</p> <!---->

So on the Ipad im begging to have community posts able to be seen. Just make it like the phone but wider. Its stressing me how much I miss stuff because people normally post on the community post option. I have to go on my phone just to see it. Another one is PLEASE update the notification area. It use to be amazing before until you guys changed it. I am not going to lie but you people are ruining your app to the worst. I don’t wanna come off harsh or anything but it is very annoying. I am gonna keep my rating on 4 stars till you guys improve. For now it’s staying on 4. Another issue is the search thing glitch (i think glitch). It would just not let me delete my search or click on it. I have no idea why but i would like to no because its annoying me a lot. <br><br>I wanna say thank you for your time!</p> <!---->

            <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>Hi, so I’m having a two issues with this app so hopefully someone will see this;<br><br>1) My playlists are not updating: so I added a few songs to one of my playlist and when I click on the song that I want to play it’s not there even though it said that it was added to my playlist so when I refresh the page hoping that it would work it’s still not there (I.e. I have 222 songs in my playlist but when I click on one song it says I only have 220) I tried to rearrange the songs in the playlist to see if it would show up this time but it doesn’t which leads to the next issue... the refreshing the page issue.<br><br>2) When I refresh the page all of my playlist are deleted the only thing that’s on the page is my watch later, history, but when I refresh the page again some of my playlists come back but the rest of them are still missing (and no I didn’t delete them) I refresh the page again and all of them are back but I feel like I shouldn’t have to refresh the page three times in order to get all of my playlists back you know what I mean? I tried deleting the app and reinstalling to see if that would work but it doesn’t and this has been going on for the past couple of days.</p> <!---->

It works well and is a nice quality app. I have a few problems though, and it has to do with the subscription tab. The first problem is that it will often say that someone has posted (showing a little blue dot on their icon) but they haven’t. No big deal, but if I click it to make the blue dot go away, then go back to a different tab (such as the home) it will put the blue dot back. That makes it so there is a red dot on the subscription button which just bothers me. It also usually happens to people with less that 1k subs.\nThe second problem I have is that I don’t get all community posts. I am subscribed to a lot of people, and a good amount of them make posts regularly. Maybe this is supposed to happen, but I don’t get them all, and I would like to. \nThe last problem (which I find more funny) is that when I click all to see everyone I am subscribed to, it shows everyone as normal. But, if I leave the app and come back, or slide up on my phone (to show brightness or flashlight) it will switch around the names so that they do not match the right person.\n\nOther than these three problems, the app is amazing.","title":"A Few Annoying Problems...","userName":"ME I SENT THIS!"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"6613135743","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2020-11-06T00:13:18Z","rating":4,"review":"I hate the new update for the comments.

I have 222 songs in my playlist but when I click on one song it says I only have 220) I tried to rearrange the songs in the playlist to see if it would show up this time but it doesn’t which leads to the next issue... the refreshing the page issue.\n\n2) When I refresh the page all of my playlist are deleted the only thing that’s on the page is my watch later, history, but when I refresh the page again some of my playlists come back but the rest of them are still missing (and no I didn’t delete them) I refresh the page again and all of them are back but I feel like I shouldn’t have to refresh the page three times in order to get all of my playlists back you know what I mean?

It’s nothing revolutionary, and I do think it’s gotten better, at least on the iPad version. However, there’s one issue (that really just annoys me more than anything.) On the bottom row, on the corner of the icon that indicates subscriptions, a red dot will appear to (I’m guessing) notify you that there’s a new video from someone you’re subscribed to. But most of the time, the red dot appears even when there’s nothing new. It’ll go away when you click on it and are in the subscription box, stay away when you go to a different page, but randomly appear again shortly after. Typically it’s when you refresh any page, but I’ve seen it reappear out on nowhere for no reason when I’m just browsing. It’s super annoying to think there’s something new when there isn’t.\n It’s such a tiny problem, but if you think about it, so’s a mosquito. That little subscription alert that shows up for no reason is like getting bit by a mosquito over and over and over again.

Now the top of the UI with the notification bell etc. end up ABOVE the top of the screen. Pulling down as if to refresh makes it visible again, but you can’t tap the bell or anything; it just springs back up when you release ?\n\nI also HATE HATE HATE that playing something from a playlist opens up the freaking playlist ON THE VIDEO PAGE, completely obscuring the video interaction buttons like thumbs up/down, comments, etc. My hunch is that they do this to hide whether or not you’ve already watched it to try to trick you into watching it again for the ad views. They love doing this in the main feed, where they’ll usually show you a red bar at the bottom of the thumbnail for videos you’ve already watched before, but not always! Sometimes you’ll tap to check and then see that you’ve already watched it before because you already gave it a thumbs up or down. It’s infuriating that they insist on trying to trick you into rewatching stuff. I NEVER WANT TO REWATCH A VIDEO!\n\nFinally, WHY IS THERE NO OPTION TO DISABLE AUTOPLAY ON PLAYLISTS?!

Moving the comments under the description is problematic because 1. it’s easily missable 2. it made going/making a comment more difficult 3. the fluidity of scrolling for other videos and going to the comments made sense 4. having the back button on the left side (in addition to muscle memory of clicking on the newly “escape” right side) makes it plain tedious.\n\nthe thumbnails are also an issue because they are too large. one video thumbnail alone takes up almost half the screen and with two of them it takes up the whole screen. less is more, and bigger doesn’t always mean better. please consider reinventing the layout because it’s problematic having people used to one idea and completely changing it.","title":"the new update","userName":"Mahalhaaa"},"relationships":{}},{"id":"6434062899","type":"media/review","attributes":{"date":"2020-09-16T07:05:33Z","rating":3,"review":"I understand the need for advertisements but it’s to the point now that it’s negatively impacting my experience.  Now that there’s two, back to back ads in every break it’s irritating how much I have to interact with the app just to finish watching the video.  The more I use the app the worse the experience gets.  I usually like to use the app while doing other things like cooking or cleaning.  I mostly listen and don’t always have my phone in hand. In an 11 minute video with 6 ads, the middle break had a 30 second unskippable ad followed by a 2 minute ad that was skippable.  Unless I am physically on my phone to return to the video that would be 2:30 minutes of ads just for 1 of 3 ad breaks in an 11 minute video.  It’s overload.  \nI get that using the free version means you gets ads but it’s overshadowing the content.  I don’t want to interact this much with something I’m watching.  It’s not a game app.  Guess I’ll just stick to watching it on the desktop with my ad blocker.  \n\nOtherwise, yeah YT is ok.  They’re just getting into Pandora territory which is disappointing.
